description: '"Chaucer''s Works, Volume 4 — The Canterbury Tales" by Geoffrey Chaucer
  is a collection of narrative poems written in the 14th century. This edition presents
  an edited version of the famous tales, which are framed within a pilgrimage context,
  where various characters share their stories along the journey to Canterbury Cathedral.
  The work features a diverse cast of characters, each with unique backgrounds and
  social standings, including the Knight, the Squire, and the Prioress, offering a
  vivid portrayal of medieval society.  At the start of "The Canterbury Tales," the
  scene is set in April, a time traditionally associated with renewal and pilgrimage.
  The narrator introduces the story by explaining that he decided to join a group
  of twenty-nine pilgrims at the Tabard Inn in Southwark, who are preparing to travel
  to Canterbury. As the gathering is described, readers get a glimpse into the personalities
  and social standings of various characters, laying the groundwork for the tales
  they will tell. This opening sets a unique tone for the journey, blending themes
  of faith, storytelling, and camaraderie with the anticipation of shared experiences
  and moral reflections on life. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
