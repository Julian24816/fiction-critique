description: '"The Turn of the Screw" by Henry James is a gothic novella written during
  the late 19th century. The story revolves around a young governess tasked with looking
  after two orphaned children at a remote English estate known as Bly, where strange
  and unsettling occurrences unfold, raising questions about both the environment
  and the children themselves.  At the start of the novella, a group of friends gathers
  around a fire on Christmas Eve, where a conversation ignites about ghostly experiences.
  Douglas, one of the members, hints at a chilling tale involving two children to
  whom a dreadful apparition appeared. This sets the stage for the recounting of the
  governess''s experiences at Bly. As she arrives at the estate, she finds herself
  enchanted by the beauty of the children, Miles and Flora, yet underlying this charm
  is an unsettling tension hinted at through dialogue, especially about the previous
  governess who died under mysterious circumstances. The opening sequence effectively
  builds an atmosphere of suspense, promising a haunting exploration of innocence,
  corrupted motives, and the supernatural. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
