description: '"The Time Machine" by H. G. Wells is a science fiction novel written
  in the late 19th century. The story introduces a brilliant Time Traveller who presents
  his revolutionary ideas about time and space to a group of skeptical friends, discussing
  the concept of a fourth dimension that intertwines with our understanding of time.  The
  opening portion reveals the Time Traveller engaging his guests in a lively conversation
  about his theories of time travel, demonstrating his intellect and confidence. He
  showcases a small model of the time machine he has created, which he explains will
  allow him to journey through time. His companions express disbelief and skepticism
  regarding his claims, leading to a tense yet intriguing atmosphere. As the narrative
  progresses, the Time Traveller prepares for an actual demonstration of his invention,
  setting the stage for his soon-to-be incredible journey into both the past and the
  future. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
