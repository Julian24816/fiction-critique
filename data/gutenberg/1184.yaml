description: '"The Count of Monte Cristo" by Alexandre Dumas and Auguste Maquet is
  a renowned novel written during the early 19th century. The story explores themes
  of justice, revenge, and redemption, primarily through the journey of its main character,
  Edmond Dantès, a young sailor who is unjustly imprisoned. The narrative begins to
  unfold in the bustling port city of Marseilles, setting the stage for the intricate
  relationships and betrayals that will define Dantès'' life.  At the start of the
  book, we are introduced to Edmond Dantès, who has just returned to Marseilles aboard
  the ship Pharaon. He is celebrated for his successful voyage, but the arrival casts
  a shadow of jealousy on some individuals around him, particularly Danglars and Fernand,
  who have their own motives. The opening chapters illustrate Edmond''s joyous reunion
  with his father and his betrothed, Mercédès, but it also hints at the brewing conspiracies,
  particularly as the jealous Fernand and cunning Danglars scheme against him. This
  builds a sense of impending doom as Dantès'' happiness appears to be fragile and
  precarious against the backdrop of jealousy and ambition from those close to him.
