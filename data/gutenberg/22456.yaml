description: '"The Aeneid of Virgil" by Virgil is a classic epic poem written in the
  late 1st century BC. The poem narrates the legendary exploits of Aeneas, a Trojan
  hero and the forefather of the Romans, as he embarks on a tumultuous journey from
  the ruins of Troy to find a new homeland in Italy. Central to the story is Aeneas''s
  struggles against divine forces, particularly the wrath of Juno, and his relentless
  pursuit of destiny, amid themes of fate, duty, and the foundation of a great civilization.  At
  the start of "The Aeneid," Aeneas is introduced as a noble warrior who survives
  the fall of Troy and is propelled by fate to establish a new city in Italy. The
  opening details the fierce opposition he faces from Juno, who harbors resentment
  against the Trojans. Guided by divine intervention, Aeneas and his fleet are shipwrecked
  on the coast of Carthage, where he seeks refuge and encounters the strong-willed
  Queen Dido. As Aeneas reflects on his harrowing journey and lost comrades, the stormy
  conflict between personal desires and divine mandates begins to unfold, setting
  the stage for the epic''s exploration of heroism and destiny. (This is an automatically
