description: '"The Decameron" by Giovanni Boccaccio is a collection of short stories
  written in the 14th century. This seminal work features a framing narrative in which
  a group of ten nobles—seven women and three men—flee the decaying city of Florence
  during the Black Death. As they take refuge in the countryside, each member of the
  group recounts a tale over ten separate days, resulting in a rich tapestry of stories
  that explore themes such as love, deception, and morality.  The opening of "The
  Decameron" sets a somber tone as it vividly describes the devastation wrought by
  the plague in Florence. Boccaccio introduces the characters, focusing on the plight
  of the city''s inhabitants amidst their growing fear and abandonment in the face
  of the epidemic. As the narrative progresses, a group of seven young ladies, seeking
  solace from their grim surroundings, decides to escape to the countryside. Their
  leader, Pampinea, proposes that they share joyous stories to divert their minds
  from grief. This initial setup establishes the framework for the subsequent tales,
  promising a mix of wit and wisdom that illustrates both the human condition and
  the resilience of those experiencing turmoil. (This is an automatically generated
