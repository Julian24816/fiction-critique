description: '"The Yellow Wallpaper" by Charlotte Perkins Gilman is a short story
  written in the late 19th century, often associated with the feminist literature
  genre. The narrative explores the themes of mental illness, gender roles, and the
  constraints faced by women in a patriarchal society. It follows the mental deterioration
  of a woman who is confined to a room by her husband, who is also her physician,
  under the pretense of helping her recover from what he diagnoses as temporary nervous
  depression.  The story is presented as a series of journal entries written by an
  unnamed woman who is taken to a secluded mansion for rest cure. As she spends time
  in the nursery, she becomes increasingly obsessed with the room''s yellow wallpaper,
  which she finds repulsive yet fascinating. Over time, she perceives a figure of
  a woman trapped within the wallpaper, reflecting her own feelings of oppression
  and entrapment. As the protagonist''s isolation and desperation grow, she begins
  to identify with the figure, leading to a dramatic climax where she asserts her
  will by tearing down the wallpaper, ultimately rejecting the control her husband
  has over her life. The story is a powerful commentary on the struggles against patriarchal
  domination and the importance of self-identity and freedom. (This is an automatically
