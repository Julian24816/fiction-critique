description: '"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" by L. Frank Baum is a children''s novel
  written in the late 19th century. The story centers around Dorothy, a young girl
  from Kansas who is swept away by a cyclone to the magical land of Oz. To return
  home, she embarks on a journey to meet the great Wizard Oz, meeting various characters
  along the way who each seek something they believe they lack, such as brains, a
  heart, and courage. The enchanting and imaginative world promises themes of friendship,
  adventure, and self-discovery.  At the start of the narrative, we are introduced
  to Dorothy and her simple life on the Kansas prairie, living with her Uncle Henry
  and Aunt Em. One day, a cyclone uproots her home, and when she awakens, she finds
  herself in the vibrant and unfamiliar land of Oz, where she inadvertently kills
  the Wicked Witch of the East. Grateful Munchkins celebrate her arrival as a hero,
  and she learns she must travel to the Emerald City to seek help from the Wizard
  Oz. Along her journey, she meets the Scarecrow, who desires brains; the Tin Woodman,
  needing a heart; and the Cowardly Lion, who seeks courage. Together, they navigate
  various challenges, illustrating themes of bravery, kindness, and the quest for
  self-improvement against the backdrop of Baum''s whimsical and vivid creations.
