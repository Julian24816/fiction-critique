description: '"The Golden Asse" by Lucius Apuleius is a novel written in the 2nd century
  AD. The story follows the protagonist, Lucius, who undergoes a series of transformative
  adventures after he becomes accidentally transformed into an ass. As he navigates
  the trials and tribulations of his new form, Lucius seeks knowledge and experiences
  that ultimately lead him to a deeper understanding of love, transformation, and
  the nature of humanity.  At the start of the narrative, we are introduced to Lucius,
  who embarks on a journey to Thessaly, a region notorious for its witchcraft. Accompanying
  him are two strangers who discuss the powers of sorcery, setting the stage for Lucius''s
  ensuing misadventures with witches and magic. Through a series of humorous and poignant
  encounters—including a notable episode involving a juggler and his impressive feats—Lucius''s
  curiosity about witchcraft grows. He learns about the significant role these practices
  play in the lives of those surrounding him while reflecting on the history and power
  dynamics at play in Thessaly. The opening chapters set up a rich tapestry of themes
  that include exploration, transformation, and the complexities of human desire.
