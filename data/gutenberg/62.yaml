description: '"A Princess of Mars" by Edgar Rice Burroughs is a science fiction novel
  written in the early 20th century. The story is set on Mars, known as Barsoom, where
  the protagonist, John Carter, an Earthman, finds himself after a mysterious series
  of events. He navigates the hostile Martian landscape, encounters strange creatures,
  and becomes embroiled in the conflicts of various Martian tribes, all while striving
  to protect the beautiful Martian princess, Dejah Thoris.  The opening of the book
  introduces John Carter as an enigmatic character who claims to have experienced
  death and resurrection. Reflecting on his past, he recounts his life as a Confederate
  soldier in America and his subsequent adventure in Mars'' stunning and treacherous
  wilderness. As he begins his journey, he faces threats from Apaches and realizes
  he has been transported to another world, where his physical prowess is enhanced.
  The narrative sets the stage for action, adventure, and deeper exploration of Martian
  culture, putting John Carter at the center of a struggle that could change the fate
  of Barsoom, particularly in his quest to save Dejah Thoris from peril. (This is
