description: '"Wuthering Heights" by Emily Brontë is a novel penned in the early 19th
  century. The story centers around the intense and turbulent relationships among
  the residents of Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange, particularly focusing
  on the enigmatic figure of Heathcliff and his connection to Catherine Earnshaw.
  It delves into themes of love, revenge, and the haunting consequences of past actions,
  set against the backdrop of the desolate Yorkshire moors.  The beginning of "Wuthering
  Heights" introduces us to Mr. Lockwood, who has recently taken a rental at Thrushcross
  Grange and decides to visit his reclusive landlord, Mr. Heathcliff, at Wuthering
  Heights. Lockwood''s encounter with Heathcliff is marked by unease, revealing a
  hostile atmosphere filled with mistrust and discontent. The narrative then hints
  at Heathcliff’s complicated past as an orphan taken in by the Earnshaw family, setting
  up an exploration of social hierarchies and emotional scars that form the crux of
  the novel. As Lockwood navigates his burgeoning curiosity about these charged family
  dynamics, he inadvertently becomes entangled in the brooding past that shapes the
  characters'' present lives, notably those of Heathcliff and Catherine. (This is
