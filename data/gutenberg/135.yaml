description: '"Les Misérables" by Victor Hugo is a novel written in the mid-19th century.
  It explores the themes of justice, morality, and the struggle between good and evil
  through the lives of its characters, primarily focusing on the troubled yet redemptive
  journey of Jean Valjean, a man trying to escape his past. The narrative also intertwines
  various social issues, illustrating the plight of the poor and marginalized in society.  The
  beginning of "Les Misérables" introduces Bishop Myriel, a kind and selfless man
  exemplifying compassion and charity in a world rife with injustice. The narrative
  establishes his character as an embodiment of Christian values, emphasizing his
  willingness to give up his comforts to aid the needy. Through his actions—like turning
  his episcopal residence into a hospital for the poor and his dialogue with the people—Hugo
  sets the foundation for the moral questions that will resonate throughout the novel.
  This opening portion establishes the tone and themes that will play a crucial role
  in the development of the story as it unfolds. (This is an automatically generated
