description: '"An Old Babylonian Version of the Gilgamesh Epic" by Morris Jastrow
  Jr. and Albert T. Clay is a scholarly publication that explores the ancient Mesopotamian
  epic, likely written in the early 20th century. This work presents a translation
  and analysis of recently discovered Old Babylonian texts of the Gilgamesh Epic,
  focusing on its narrative structure, themes, and historical context. The book highlights
  the adventures of the titular hero, Gilgamesh, and his companion Enkidu as they
  confront the challenges of friendship, mortality, and the search for immortality.  At
  the start of this publication, the authors provide essential background on the Gilgamesh
  Epic, stating its significance in Babylonian literature and outlining the fragmentary
  nature of its preservation. The introduction discusses the structure of the epic,
  particularly the interaction and eventual friendship between Gilgamesh and Enkidu,
  along with their collective battles against formidable foes. It hints at the deeper
  philosophical explorations of life, death, and the human condition that underpin
  the narrative. The opening also discusses the importance of the two tablets that
  serve as the foundation for this Babylonian version, allowing scholars to trace
  its evolution and connections to broader historical and cultural themes. (This is
