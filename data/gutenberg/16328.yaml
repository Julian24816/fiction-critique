description: '"Beowulf: An Anglo-Saxon Epic Poem" by J. Lesslie Hall is an epic poem
  written in the late 19th century. The narrative focuses on the heroic figure Beowulf,
  a warrior from Geatland, who seeks to help Hrothgar, the Danish king, rid his land
  of the monstrous creature Grendel that has been terrorizing his mead-hall. This
  tale weaves themes of heroism, loyalty, and the struggle between good and evil,
  set against the backdrop of the early medieval period.  The opening of the poem
  introduces the legacy of Scyld, the founding king of the Danes, and his great lineage,
  leading up to Hrothgar''s reign. After building Heorot, a grand mead-hall, Hrothgar
  faces despair as Grendel attacks nightly, slaughtering his warriors. Word of Hrothgar''s
  plight reaches Beowulf, who decides to journey to the Danes with a band of fourteen
  warriors to confront Grendel. The scene is set for a monumental clash between the
  might of Beowulf and the terror of Grendel, emphasizing the values of strength,
  courage, and honor that define the epic tradition. (This is an automatically generated
  summary.)'
