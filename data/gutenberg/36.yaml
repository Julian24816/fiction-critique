description: '"The War of the Worlds" by H. G. Wells is a science fiction novel written
  in the late 19th century, during a time when literature began to explore themes
  of alien life and the potential consequences of space exploration. The narrative
  focuses on the harrowing invasion of Earth by Martians, highlighting the struggles
  of human civilization when faced with technologically superior beings. The story
  is primarily told through the experiences of an unnamed protagonist who witnesses
  the unfolding chaos.  At the start of the book, the stage is set for an extraordinary
  and unsettling invasion. It opens with a reflective take on humanity''s ignorance
  of the vastness of space and the potential dangers that lie beyond it. Soon, the
  protagonist observes a falling star that turns out to be a mysterious cylinder from
  Mars, which crashes on Horsell Common. Alongside astronomers who first notice disturbing
  phenomena on Mars, the protagonist soon becomes entwined in the ensuing panic once
  it becomes apparent that extraterrestrial beings are making a terrifying arrival.
  As the narrative explores the fears and reactions of those witnessing the Martian
  emergence, the tone is charged with suspense, foreshadowing the catastrophic events
  that are about to unfold. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
