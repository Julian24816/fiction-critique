description: '"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus" by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley
  is a novel written in the early 19th century. The story centers around Victor Frankenstein,
  a brilliant but obsessive scientist whose quest to conquer death leads him to create
  a living being from dead matter. The novel explores themes of ambition, the pursuit
  of knowledge, and the consequences of isolation and responsibility.  At the start
  of the novel, we are introduced to Robert Walton, an explorer on an expedition to
  the North Pole, who encounters a weakened Victor Frankenstein. Walton initially
  writes letters to his sister, sharing his excitement about his journey and expressing
  a longing for companionship and understanding. As Victor regains his strength aboard
  Walton''s ship, he begins to share the tragic tale of his life, hinting at the catastrophic
  outcomes of his relentless scientific pursuits and the monstrous being he brought
  to life. The opening sets the tone for a story that delves into the darker sides
  of ambition and the human psyche, promising a rich narrative of horror and moral
  inquiry. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
