description: '"The Castle of Otranto" by Horace Walpole is a Gothic novel written
  in the late 18th century. The story unfolds in a mysterious castle where supernatural
  occurrences intertwine with human tragedy and ambition, centering on the tumultuous
  life of Manfred, the Prince of Otranto, whose actions stem from an ancient prophecy
  threatening his lineage. The characters include his beautiful daughter Matilda,
  the sickly son Conrad, and Isabella, the unwilling bride-to-be who becomes embroiled
  in the family''s dark machinations.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced
  to Manfred and his family as preparations for the wedding of his son Conrad to Isabella
  are underway. However, tragedy strikes when Conrad is crushed to death by a giant
  helmet, triggering a chain of events that reveals the superstitions and tensions
  underlying Manfred''s desperate desire for heirs. With Conrad''s sudden death, Manfred
  becomes fixated on Isabella, disregarding her feelings, and reveals his tyrannical
  nature. The opening captures gothic themes of horror, fate, and the fragility of
  human connections, setting the stage for the ensuing drama and intrigue within the
  castle. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
