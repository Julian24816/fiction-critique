description: '"The Call of the Wild" by Jack London is a novel written in the late
  19th century, during the time of the Klondike Gold Rush. The story revolves around
  Buck, a domesticated St. Bernard-Scotch Shepherd mix, who is thrust into the brutal
  and primal world of the Yukon wilderness, forced to shed his civilized upbringing
  and adapt to a harsh life of survival.  The opening of the book introduces Buck,
  who lives a comfortable life as a pet in Judge Miller''s home in the Santa Clara
  Valley. However, his idyllic existence comes to an end when he is kidnapped by Manuel,
  a gardener''s helper with gambling debts. Buck is soon transported to the north,
  where he faces mistreatment and a stark new reality. The narrative sets the stage
  for Buck''s transformation from a pampered pet to a fierce survivor, illustrating
  the conflict between civilization and the primal instincts that begin to awaken
  within him as he navigates life in a wild, unforgiving landscape. (This is an automatically
