description: '"Anna Karenina" by graf Leo Tolstoy is a novel written in the late 19th
  century. This complex literary work explores themes of love, morality, and social
  conflict, primarily through the tumultuous life of its titular character, Anna Karenina.
  The story begins with the unraveling of a marriage and sets the stage for an intricate
  examination of personal and societal dilemmas faced by its characters.  The opening
  of the novel introduces Stepan Arkadjevitsh Oblonski, affectionately known as Stiva,
  whose marital troubles with his wife Dolly are laid bare after she discovers his
  infidelity with a former governess. This domestic strife creates a chaotic atmosphere
  in the Oblonski household, affecting not just the couple but also their children
  and servants. As Stiva grapples with guilt and the implications of his actions,
  the narrative hints at deeper questions regarding fidelity, happiness, and social
  conventions in Russian society, setting a profound groundwork for the interwoven
  stories that follow in the lives of Anna and those around her. (This is an automatically
