description: '"The Picture of Dorian Gray" by Oscar Wilde is a novel written in the
  late 19th century. The story delves into themes of beauty, morality, and the nature
  of art through the life of its main character, Dorian Gray, a young man whose portrait
  reflects the consequences of his increasingly decadent and hedonistic lifestyle
  while he remains outwardly youthful and attractive.  At the start of the novel,
  the scene is set in an artist''s studio where Basil Hallward is painting a portrait
  of the extraordinarily handsome Dorian Gray, who is unaware of the profound impact
  he has on those around him. Lord Henry Wotton, Basilâ€™s friend, comments on the portrait
  and expresses a fascination with Dorian, hinting at a charismatic yet morally complex
  influence he intends to exert over the young man. As the opening unfolds, Dorian''s
  admiration for his own beauty becomes apparent, setting the stage for the internal
  and external conflicts he will face as he navigates the duality of his existence,
  juxtaposing his physical allure with the darker aspects of his character and choices.
